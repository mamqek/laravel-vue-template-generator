Only need to ensure that the folder is created in the container
In compose file this email directory (the one this file is in) is linked to templates directory, so can even make changes to templates without reloading 

-- Ensure folder exists
docker exec directus-stack-directus-1 mkdir -p /directus/templates

-- Hard reload of container if changed env
docker compose up -d --force-recreate directus

-- If have an error that template is missing when it si there, probably permissions issues for the email dir on server
# make directories traversable and readable
find ./email -type d -exec chmod 755 {} +
# make files readable
find ./email -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +

The rest of important configuration is in .env
